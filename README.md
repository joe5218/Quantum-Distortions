Our encoding and decoding function relies on the FRQI (Flexible Representation of Quantum Images) method whose fundamentals can be found in the IBM Qiskit Textbook: https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-applications/image-processing-frqi-neqr.html.


The FRQI package that was utilized to use said method can be found in user Paritosh Chauhan's Github: https://github.com/paritoshkc/Quantum-Computing/blob/master/frqi.py and in user Shedka's Github: https://github.com/Shedka/citiesatnight/blob/master/frqi.py.
